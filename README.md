Renders a pdf file into 10x10 grid of A4-scaled images.

Usage: Just run `python pdf2texture.py`. It will scan all pdf files in `source/` and convert them in `result/`.
If the PDF file contains more than 100 pages, multiple images are generated.

I used this to import a book into Neos VR. Not sure if this code can be useful elsewhere, but I'm putting this code here for my own sake.

Output example:
![image](result/동백꽃.png)
